# Contact-Management-System

The Contact Management System (CMS) is a console-based application developed in C that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. The system provides functionalities to add, display, search, and sort contacts based on various criteria. This project aims to demonstrate the use of data structures, searching, and sorting algorithms, making it a practical tool for managing personal or professional contacts.

Features
Add Contact: Users can add new contacts by entering details such as name, phone number, and email address.
Display Contacts: Users can view all stored contacts in a formatted list.
Search Contacts: Users can search for contacts using multiple criteria, including name, phone number, or email address.
Sort Contacts: Users can sort the contacts based on different fields (name, phone number, email) using various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
User -Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple text-based menu for easy navigation and interaction.
Data Structures
Contact Structure: A structure to hold contact information, including name, phone number, and email.
Array of Contacts: An array to store multiple contacts, with a maximum limit defined (e.g., 100 contacts).

Displaying Contacts:

Loop through the contact array and print each contact's details.
Searching Contacts:

Prompt the user for a search term.
Search through the contact array for matches in name, phone, or email.
Display matching contacts.
Sorting Contacts:

Allow the user to choose a sorting criterion (name, phone, email).
Implement sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort) to sort the contacts based on the chosen criterion.
User Interface:

Provide a menu-driven interface for users to select options.
Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
